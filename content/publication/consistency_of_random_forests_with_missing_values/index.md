abstract: "This paper tackles the problem of constructing a non-parametric predictor when the latent
variables are given with incomplete information. The convenient predictor for this task is the
random forest algorithm in conjunction to the so-called CART criterion. The proposed technique
enables a partial imputation of the missing values in the data set in a way that suits both a
consistent estimator of the regression function as well as a partial recovery of the missing values.
A proof of the consistency of the random forest estimator is given in the case where each latent
variable is missing completely at random (MCAR)."
