abstract: "In this paper, we present the practical benefits of a new random forest algorithm to deal with missing values in the sample.
The purpose of this work is to compare the different solutions to deal with missing values using random forests and describe the new
algorithm performance as well as its algorithmic complexity. A variety of data-missing mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) are considered and
simulated. We study the quadratic errors and the bias of our algorithm and compare them to the most popular missing values random forests
algorithms in the literature. In particular, we compare those techniques for both regression and prediction purposes. This work follows
the paper of Gómez-Méndez and Joly [On the consistency of a random forest algorithm in the presence of missing entries. 2020. Available from:
arXiv:201105433] on the consistency of this new algorithm.<br><br>
