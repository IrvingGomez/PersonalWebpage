I am a postdoctoral researcher at the laboratory of
Strategic Analytics Networks with Machine Learning and AI (SAI) 
of the Data Science and Analytics Research Group (DSARG) at the 
<a href="https://www.nectec.or.th/" target="_blank"> National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)</a> in Thailand.
I hold a PhD in Probability and  Statistics from the
<a href="https://www.cimat.mx" target="_blank"> Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (CIMAT)</a> with the thesis titled
'Random Forests and Autoencoders with Missing Data' under the direction of
<a href="https://www.cimat.mx/es/emilien-joly" target="_blank"> Emilien Joly </a>.
From January to March 2020, I was in a research stay at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/centre/lille" target="_blank"> Inria-Lille</a>
in collaboration with <a href="https://jjv.ie/" target="_blank"> Jill-Jênn Vie </a> working on variational autoencoders with missing data.
