There are a lot of things that I would like that somebody would have told me before I started my PhD. However, I learned must of these issues by myself during the process. Fortunately, if you search a little bit you can find with people that, like me, decided to write their experience. So, instead of telling you my whole story, I am going to make reference to those who have written before me, just adding some comments.

The first post that can clarify (a lot) many issues about a PhD is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07332-x">Twenty things I wish I’d known when I started my PhD</a>, which has been my inspiration for this post. Here are some of the points that I find more important

<ul>
  <li>
    Always back up your work! Make sure that you can always recover your work, a PhD is a long time project, and many things could happened in the middle. Actually make as many back ups as you could, on an external HHD, on your laptop, on your office's computer, on the cloud.
  </li>
  <li>
    I would definitely emphasize more: Submit to journals asap! Journals are a pain in the ass, you have to change the manuscript of your research to the format of the journal (and each journal has its own format), which might requires some effort. The review times are long and after waiting for MONTHS your work might be rejected, with completely useless comments like. Just move forward and try in a different place, just remember that publishing requires A LOT of time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Definitely DO NOT compare yourself with others. There is no worldwide standard for a PhD (I will come back to this point later). In some places a PhD is just a continuation of your advisor's research, and is focused on publishing. Other PhD's (like mine) are focused on the development of your own original research, so you might have less publications that others.
  </li>
</ul>

There are two points that I would like to explain a little bit more. There is no standard of what a thesis would be or not. From one institution to another the rules are different, and the conditions to get the degree are different. In a nutshell, everybody knows more less what a doctor should be, but there is no consensus on how to become one. About these problem I really recommend to read <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/what-s-the-point-of-the-phd-thesis-1.20203">What’s the point of the PhD thesis?</a>. As commented there, "The job market for postdoc positions is very competitive,” he says, “so if you can get a paper published during your PhD then you're helping yourself." Right now the next sentence describes me: "I'm wondering: would it not have been better to write these instead of the thesis, which took me five months to write?"

Furthermore, the concept of what is and what is not a PhD thesis has changed during the time, as commented in <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/back-to-the-thesis-1.20202">Back to the thesis</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-past-present-and-future-of-the-phd-thesis-1.20207">The past, present and future of the PhD thesis</a>. I would specially want to retake the sentence: "(..) students in the process of writing a thesis can find themselves in a very dark place indeed: lost in information, overwhelmed by literature, stuck for the next sentence, seduced by procrastination and wondering why on earth they signed up to this torture at all." Writing the manuscript is everything but enjoyable, start doing that as soon as possible.
